# The goal of this repo:
- Creating a deep convolutional generative adversarial network, that is reproduceable and can be deployed from the command line.

## Data:
- the data is from keras' fashion mnist dataset

## How to reproduce this project:
0. You must have pre installed python v3 on your machine.
1. Install virtualenv: pip install virtualenv
2. Create a venv for the project: virtualenv venv --python=python3
3. Activate the venv: source venv/bin/activate (for linux) venv\Scripts\activate.bat (for windws)
4. Install python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
